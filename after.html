        <h2>Reflections of the Trip</h2>
        <hr style="width:50%">
        <p align="center">
            Every trip has 3 phases: plan - travel - fun!!
BUT this trip had 4th, fear

Planning of this trip actually started before our mid-semester exams with only 2 members on board, the Finance Secretary of the group, Satyam, who actually proposed this trip to Mathura, and another rascal, who is ready to even to the moon and beyond, Aryan
it was the same for, I guess, 4 more days, this plan would have been most probability has been cancelled, if, I, the narrator of the story, told Satyam that I'm in, for real man, I have just assumed that my parents wouldn't allow me to go, all I did was that 
I told my mom that my friends were going to Mathura by themselves, and she was like, "Nothing wrong with Mathura"(maybe cuz it's nearby Delhi). Others also joined, even to the last day of booking, and THE TRIP WAS ONN!!!!!

(no one could sleep at night, it seems)

the train was scheduled for 7 in the morning, all were ON TIME (thank god), the journey started, and the fun was just to begin; we had 8 sitting class tickets, bought for 90 rupees each (thanks to Satyam), the journey was short, around 1.5 hours, as much as our 
maths lecture last, we all sat, ate snacks we brought and had a really fun time chatting about college and all; the train journey ended like thanos snap

We got off at the station, and guess what, how did Mathura welcome us.....? a ticket collector asked us to show our tickets as if we were travelling without them, and it's also not his fault, as it's said famously that if men are happy they either received a 
compliment from a girl or they did something illegal, I guess he assumed the second case. Also, while doing so, we saw ACTION, naa just kidding, we saw a woman trying to get on a moving train, being dragged, and I couldn't believe, not what I saw, but what I heard,
"poore 90 rupee vasool ho gye" I heard, some bastard (maintaining anonymity) in our group said this, and we all laughed about it, believe me it was the last thing I wanted to hear.

Anyway, after showing TC our tickets and his aukaat (he thought he was the main character), we got off, found a local driver, and were off to Vrindavan, as per our POA(the plan of action); sorry to mention it earlier, POA was that we will visit all places in Vrindavan first,
till 12 noon and then Janam Bhoomi temple, which was in Mathura, in the evening. Of course, the POA failed, and in the end, we ran short on time. 

Upon reaching Vrindavan, we first visited shri Bankey Bihari temple, which was a mesmerizing experience, a bit crowded, but glimpse of lord Krishna was above all that. This was followed by a visit to Nidhivan and Vrindavan's ghat. Couple of hours there clicking photos, 
mostly by 2 wanna be photoholics of the group; anyway, we then went to prem mandir, clicking more photos. At last, Vrindavan was done.

On the way back to Mathura, me and sheel decided to sit on the back side of Tempo Traveller, which was not the best decision made cuz there were some moments where we felt so.. (guilt face emoji)

Janam bhoomi temple didn't allow any electronic items inside, for justified reasons i guess, the most attractive part the temple was the cell in where lord krishna was born, the wall were even broader than of a room.
After finishing the trip and visiting all the holy places, it was time to get on the train to Delhi, which was not so surprisingly late.

anyway, the 4th part I talked about at the start comes now; we only had 2 confirmed tickets for the return journey for 8 people; we then came up with a master plan of buying 6 tickets for general coach (Rs.80/- each), mastermind were Satyam and me, we just didn't wanted TC to catch us,
otherwise we would have shown us our aukaat(he then would be the main character).

trip was a great success and the conclusions were;- 
1) always carry a confirmed ticket, or TC will be the main character
2) use the phone of the person to click the picture instead of yours; cuz in the end, your battery will die out soon
3) keep chanting god's name and "Wooooooo maza aa gaya bhai, wooooooo"

honourable mentions;- 
monkeys in Mathura and Vrindavan were very friendly to us, we would like to express our most tremendous gratitude to them for co-operating with us

dis-honorable mentions- 
To that one bastard who didn't come with us to Mathura (Rahul Dabbas), we had a lot of fun without you.
